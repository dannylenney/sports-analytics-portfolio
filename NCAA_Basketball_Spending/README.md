# NCAA Basketball Spending Project

### Overview
This project investigates the relationship between athletic department spending and team success in NCAA Men’s Basketball. Using R for data cleaning, visualization, and linear modeling, the analysis explores how budget size, win percentage, and team efficiency metrics (SRS) interact over multiple seasons.

### Data
- **`NCAA_Public_Data.xlsx`** – Dataset containing budget for 113 public universities (2017–2024).  
- **`srs_values.csv`** – Team efficiency metrics used for correlation and regression analysis.  
- **`win_loss_percentages.csv`** – Aggregated win-rate data across seasons.

### Analysis
- Built and interpreted a linear model using R to identify spending-performance relationships.  
- Discovered a strong correlation between budget size and team efficiency (SRS).  
- Visualized trends by conference and year to highlight spending disparities.  

### Tools
- **R** – Data cleaning, modeling, and visualization (`ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`)  
- **Excel** – Dataset compilation and preprocessing  
- **Canva** – Article visuals and publication graphics  

### Key Takeaways
- Higher athletic budgets strongly correlate with greater team efficiency and win rates.  
- Power 5 programs show diminishing returns at the highest spending tiers.  
- Group of 5 schools with mid-level spending often overperform relative to budget share.
